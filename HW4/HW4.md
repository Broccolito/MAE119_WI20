We know that the the monthly electricity demand graph looks like:

![Demand Vs. Time](C:\Users\wanju\Desktop\MAE 119\HW4\Demand Vs. Time.png)



We are also able to get that: 

- The nominal capacity of the diesel generation is 8600000 W.
- The nominal capacity of the solar generation is 1000000 W.
- The number of solar trays required is 22.
- The nominal capacity of the battery is 49300000 W

The analysis is not capturing the full value of the solar because the solar energy collected during non-outage periods can also be used to sell to make profits. After the life cycle savings are adjusted, the LCOE dropped to 0.051 and 0.108 compared to previously 0.33 and 0.70.
